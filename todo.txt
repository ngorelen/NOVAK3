-add FLR k_rad accurate computation in NOVAK3 to account for radial
 structure of the mode

-add delta Te / Te fluctuation graph to NOVA mhdst program

-add psi dependence to the distrib. function input

-add FLR effect by averaging the phase numerically exactly,
 or taking some equation to simplify the formulation. 

-consistency check: if beta_beam = 0, give a warning or stop the
 program. 

-rotation in simple version

-distrib. function in a sofisticated form.

-add to NOVAK the Python module wrapper
-add quasilinear diffusion and stability modules

-add ion Landau damping
-allow second call of the growth rate program

-allow simultaneous runs: change equot to equot_n12w1234 and
 gam_n12w1234 ...

- if eigenf is not well chosen, jumps can exist; => gg could be
  strongly negative; to solve this one need to limit too large value
  of dXi/dgy at line cnng24 (L971) in growth_prpl.f to ~10 at least;
  normally this does not happen;
