- Often when equilibrium is not good, such as in the case of Boozer
  coordinates and high beta, like in NSTX, you can see a lot of warnings
  like   

  Warning in minorrad 1 219 ...

  this is typically due to bad mapping of the equilibrium. 
  
  In this case it could be that | grad Psi |^2 is negative, or first
  radial points are too far apart due to the grid taken monotonic in
  Psi, rather than to be monotonic in sqrt(psi) recommended. 

  Try to improve equilibrium mapper. In general Boozer coordinates are
  not recommended. 

- another problem is that the continuum program breaks. The reason is 
  possibly that the grid is too dense near the center. One fix is to 
  make it more sparse. One example of such sparse grid is in the 
  gridparam file with smaller size.
